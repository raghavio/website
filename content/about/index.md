I'm Raghav from New Delhi, India :india:. I'm a full stack fella with over a decade of experience in fiddling with software. I was introduced to programming by obsessively
playing RuneScape, an MMORPG, which eventually led me explore and get involved with its emulated gaming servers written in Java.

I've spent the majority of my professional career in a fintech startup, focusing on credit cards and underwriting using a lot of Python and Postgres. The rest of my time was at a B2B SaaS startup in the HRtech space. It was an interesting experience, especially coming from a consumer startup background. However, the highlight for me was the opportunity to work with Clojure â€“ it's concise, beautiful, and I quite enjoy writing Lisp.

I love working on side projects and engaging in the yak shaving that often comes with them. All these projects can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/raghavio). My most recent one is an advanced metronome app for musicians called [Accelonome](https://accelonome.com). I'm currently in the process of converting it from VueJS to plain 'ol Javascript (remember that?).

When I'm not coding - I'm either dusting off my guitar, playing chess or worrying about my plants dying :potted_plant: :sob: . I'm always up to chat about Music, Squat form :weight_lifting_man:, Breakfast smoothies, Cold brew.
