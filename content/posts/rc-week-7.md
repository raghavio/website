#### Day 1 - Monday, Feb 12th: New batch!
I was out most of the day, but I joined right on time for Snail Rustlings group. I attended the Advice and Intros after that, and it was so nice to see all the new folks joining in. It feels... a bit different, and old?, seeing a new batch coming in. I don't know how to explain it.

I had a fun pairing session with Sareena Razak. We worked on her Pixel Palette project. We moved the app state to a JS object as a prerequisite for a CRDT integration she plans to do. Thank you for teaching me about CRDTs!

#### Day 2 - Tuesday, Feb 13th
Attended the pair programming workshop. I was matched with Jake Low and [we managed](https://replit.com/@raghavio/gol) to pull out a bare-bones Game Of Life simulation in Rust. It was great fun!

#### Day 3 - Wednesday, Feb 14th

Paired with Teresa Ibarra for Creative Coding. The prompt was "Everyone got a hungry heart." After some pondering, we decided on a version of Google's offline T-rex game. It's a T-rex with a hungry heart who is eating dinosaur chicken nuggets. Okay, that, I... I refuse to explain our thought process. It can be checked out [here](https://raghavio.github.io/hungry-heart/).

Very interesting Snail Rustlings meeting. We wrapped up the 'Move Semantics' section. Thanks to Jake Low for joining and explaining things.

#### Day 4 - Thursday, Feb 15th

I implemented the statements in my interpreter after going through some of Chapter 8 of Crafting Interpreters. In the study group, I showed my Clojure code so far, and we mostly discussed the first half of the chapter.

The presentations were fantastic as usual.

Also, I'm tired of editor-switching, and I think it's time to bite the bullet and learn Emacs. I've stalled this for over a decade now, but I see the value in using Vim/Emacs as daily drivers. VSCode is great, but I'm not satisfied with the Clojure extension. I don't want to switch to IntelliJ. Cider is the best Clojure environment, and it's on Emacs. So, yeah.

#### Day 5 - Friday, Feb 16th

I spent most of my time setting up Doom :emacs:  and my Clojure environment. I'm loving it so far! I'm horribly unproductive right now but we will get there. Over the weekend, I was obsessively learning emacs and vim bindings. My new favorite thing is the [avy](https://github.com/abo-abo/avy) package. It's short for "A velociraptor yanking". It allows you to quickly navigate between opened files.

The next plan for today is to get accustomed to shortcuts for structural editing and finish Chapter 8 of Crafting Interpreters.
