I recently quit my job and decided to take an indefinite sabbatical. One of the things I had planned was to attend the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/). As described on their website, RC is a retreat where curious programmers recharge and grow. It is something I've wanted to experience for a long time, and this break felt like the perfect opportunity.

After chilling throughout December and enjoying a refreshing trip to [AltSpace](https://www.altspaced.com/), I'm excited to kick off the new year by digging into the things I had planned for RC.

My goal is to delve into new areas and technologies I haven't explored before. Over the next 12 weeks, I hope to [work at the edge of my abilities](https://www.recurse.com/self-directives).

Here's my plan, in no particular order:

- Attempt to go through the [SICP](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html) textbook.

- Build a flutter app in Dart and then convert it to [ClojureDart](https://github.com/Tensegritics/ClojureDart).
- Gain a basic understanding of what all is happening in the ML world and study Andrej Karpathy's [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ).
- Understand database internals by actually implementing the core concepts.
- Create a digital garden to consolidate my side projects.
- Document my RC journey daily, or at least weekly.
- Pair program with other recursers on their projects.
- Learn a new language? Maybe Zig or Rust
